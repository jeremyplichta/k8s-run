### Work Log

- [2025-07-13 10:15:24] Task setup completed, TASK_MEMORY.md created
- [2025-07-13 10:30:00] ‚úÖ Implemented CPU and memory resource arguments
- [2025-07-13 10:35:00] ‚úÖ Added argument parsing for --mem and --cpu flags
- [2025-07-13 10:40:00] ‚úÖ Implemented resource specification logic in both job and deployment creation
- [2025-07-13 10:45:00] ‚úÖ Tested various resource formats (single values, ranges, different units)
- [2025-07-13 10:50:00] ‚úÖ Updated documentation with resource management examples

### Key Features Implemented

**Resource Arguments:**
- `--mem`: Memory request/limit specification
  - Single value: `--mem 8gb` (sets both requests and limits to 8gb)
  - Range format: `--mem 2gb-8gb` (sets requests to 2gb, limits to 8gb)
- `--cpu`: CPU request/limit specification
  - Supports millicores: `--cpu 1000m` 
  - Supports decimal: `--cpu 1`, `--cpu 0.5`
  - Range format: `--cpu 500m-2000m`, `--cpu 0.5-2`

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `parse_resource_spec()` method to parse resource specifications
- Updated both job and deployment creation paths with resource specifications
- Resources are properly added to Kubernetes V1ResourceRequirements
- Works with all source types (directory, GitHub, Dockerfile, container)

### Files Modified

1. **k8r.py** - Main implementation
   - Added argument parsing for --mem and --cpu
   - Implemented parse_resource_spec() method
   - Updated method signatures for run_job_with_options, create_job_with_yaml_option, create_deployment
   - Added resource specification logic in both job and deployment creation

2. **README.md** - Documentation updates
   - Added --mem and --cpu to the options table
   - Updated real-world examples to include resource specifications
   - Added dedicated "Resource Management" section with comprehensive examples
   - Added resource formats documentation

### Testing Results

All resource formats tested successfully:
- ‚úÖ Single values: `--mem 8gb --cpu 1000m`
- ‚úÖ Range format: `--mem 2gb-8gb --cpu 500m-2000m`
- ‚úÖ Decimal CPU: `--cpu 0.5-2`
- ‚úÖ Integer CPU: `--cpu 1`
- ‚úÖ Different memory units: `--mem 4gi`, `--mem 512mi`
- ‚úÖ Job creation with resources
- ‚úÖ Deployment creation with resources
- ‚úÖ YAML generation shows correct resource specifications

### Recent Work - Secret Job Reference Feature

- [2025-07-13 11:15:00] ‚úÖ Implemented `--secret-job` option for custom secret job name reference  
- [2025-07-13 11:20:00] ‚úÖ Updated secret mounting logic to use custom job name for secret discovery
- [2025-07-13 11:25:00] ‚úÖ Added support for both Jobs and Deployments
- [2025-07-13 11:30:00] ‚úÖ Added informative output when mounting secrets from different job names
- [2025-07-13 11:35:00] ‚úÖ Tested functionality with YAML generation and secret discovery

**Secret Job Reference Feature:**
- `--secret-job`: Allows specifying a different job name for secret discovery
  - Example: `k8r alpine:latest --job-name new-job --secret-job existing-job -- echo "test"`
  - Mounts secrets from `existing-job` into the new job `new-job`
  - Enables sharing secrets between jobs without duplicating them
  - Works with both Jobs and Deployments
  - Gracefully handles non-existent secret job names (no secrets mounted)

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `secret_job_name` parameter to core methods: `create_job()`, `create_job_with_yaml_option()`, `create_deployment()`, `run_job_with_options()`
- Updated secret discovery logic to use `secret_job_name` when provided, falling back to actual job name
- Enhanced user feedback to show when secrets are being mounted from a different job
- Maintains backward compatibility - existing behavior unchanged when option not used

**Files Modified:**
1. **k8r.py** - Core implementation
   - Added `--secret-job` CLI argument parsing
   - Updated method signatures to accept `secret_job_name` parameter
   - Modified secret discovery logic in `get_job_secrets()` calls
   - Enhanced output messages for cross-job secret mounting

**Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ CLI argument shows up in help output
- ‚úÖ YAML generation shows correct secret mounting from different job
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of non-existent secret job names
- ‚úÖ Compatible with both Jobs and Deployments
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained

### Additional Fix - Secret Mounting in YAML Mode

- [2025-07-13 11:45:00] üêõ **Issue Discovered**: Secrets were not being mounted in --show-yaml mode for deployments
- [2025-07-13 11:50:00] ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Updated both job and deployment creation to always include secrets in YAML output
- [2025-07-13 11:55:00] ‚úÖ **Enhanced**: Added informative warning messages when secrets are included in YAML
- [2025-07-13 12:00:00] ‚úÖ **Tested**: Verified secret mounting works correctly in all modes

**YAML Mode Secret Behavior:**
- Secrets are now always discovered and included in YAML output
- Warning message displayed: `‚ö†Ô∏è YAML includes N secrets from job 'job-name' - these secrets must exist when applying this YAML`
- Helps users understand dependency requirements when applying generated YAML later
- Works for both regular job secrets and cross-job secret references via `--secret-job`

**Implementation Details:**
- Removed `if not show_yaml:` conditions that were preventing secret discovery
- Unified secret handling logic between jobs and deployments
- Added conditional warning messages for YAML mode vs execution mode
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving YAML generation

**Updated Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ YAML mode includes secrets for both Jobs and Deployments  
- ‚úÖ Warning messages display correctly in YAML mode
- ‚úÖ Normal execution shows mounting messages (not warnings)
- ‚úÖ Cross-job secret references work in all modes
- ‚úÖ No secrets case handled gracefully
