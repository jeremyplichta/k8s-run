### Recent Work - Secret Job Reference Feature

- [2025-07-13 11:15:00] ‚úÖ Implemented `--secret-job` option for custom secret job name reference  
- [2025-07-13 11:20:00] ‚úÖ Updated secret mounting logic to use custom job name for secret discovery
- [2025-07-13 11:25:00] ‚úÖ Added support for both Jobs and Deployments
- [2025-07-13 11:30:00] ‚úÖ Added informative output when mounting secrets from different job names
- [2025-07-13 11:35:00] ‚úÖ Tested functionality with YAML generation and secret discovery

**Secret Job Reference Feature:**
- `--secret-job`: Allows specifying a different job name for secret discovery
  - Example: `k8r alpine:latest --job-name new-job --secret-job existing-job -- echo "test"`
  - Mounts secrets from `existing-job` into the new job `new-job`
  - Enables sharing secrets between jobs without duplicating them
  - Works with both Jobs and Deployments
  - Gracefully handles non-existent secret job names (no secrets mounted)

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `secret_job_name` parameter to core methods: `create_job()`, `create_job_with_yaml_option()`, `create_deployment()`, `run_job_with_options()`
- Updated secret discovery logic to use `secret_job_name` when provided, falling back to actual job name
- Enhanced user feedback to show when secrets are being mounted from a different job
- Maintains backward compatibility - existing behavior unchanged when option not used

**Files Modified:**
1. **k8r.py** - Core implementation
   - Added `--secret-job` CLI argument parsing
   - Updated method signatures to accept `secret_job_name` parameter
   - Modified secret discovery logic in `get_job_secrets()` calls
   - Enhanced output messages for cross-job secret mounting

**Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ CLI argument shows up in help output
- ‚úÖ YAML generation shows correct secret mounting from different job
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of non-existent secret job names
- ‚úÖ Compatible with both Jobs and Deployments
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained

### Additional Fix - Secret Mounting in YAML Mode

- [2025-07-13 11:45:00] üêõ **Issue Discovered**: Secrets were not being mounted in --show-yaml mode for deployments
- [2025-07-13 11:50:00] ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Updated both job and deployment creation to always include secrets in YAML output
- [2025-07-13 11:55:00] ‚úÖ **Enhanced**: Added informative warning messages when secrets are included in YAML
- [2025-07-13 12:00:00] ‚úÖ **Tested**: Verified secret mounting works correctly in all modes

**YAML Mode Secret Behavior:**
- Secrets are now always discovered and included in YAML output
- Warning message displayed: `‚ö†Ô∏è YAML includes N secrets from job 'job-name' - these secrets must exist when applying this YAML`
- Helps users understand dependency requirements when applying generated YAML later
- Works for both regular job secrets and cross-job secret references via `--secret-job`

**Implementation Details:**
- Removed `if not show_yaml:` conditions that were preventing secret discovery
- Unified secret handling logic between jobs and deployments
- Added conditional warning messages for YAML mode vs execution mode
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving YAML generation

**Updated Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ YAML mode includes secrets for both Jobs and Deployments  
- ‚úÖ Warning messages display correctly in YAML mode
- ‚úÖ Normal execution shows mounting messages (not warnings)
- ‚úÖ Cross-job secret references work in all modes
- ‚úÖ No secrets case handled gracefully

### Critical Fix - YAML Parsing Error with Secret Warnings

- [2025-07-13 15:00:00] üêõ **Issue Discovered**: YAML parsing failed when secrets were included due to warning messages being printed to stdout
- [2025-07-13 15:15:00] ‚úÖ **Root Cause**: Warning messages like `‚ö†Ô∏è YAML includes N secrets from job 'job-name'` were being printed to stdout, contaminating the YAML output
- [2025-07-13 15:20:00] ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Modified all secret warning print statements to use `file=sys.stderr` instead of stdout
- [2025-07-13 15:25:00] ‚úÖ **Tested**: Verified YAML output is now clean and valid, warnings appear on stderr

**The Problem:**
- When using `--show-yaml` with secrets, warning messages were printed to stdout along with the YAML
- This caused `kubectl apply` to fail with "mapping values are not allowed in this context" error
- Error occurred at line 2 because the warning message appeared before the actual YAML content

**The Fix:**
- Changed four print statements in k8r.py:1050, 1052, 1232, and 1234 to use `file=sys.stderr`
- This ensures warning messages go to stderr while clean YAML goes to stdout
- Maintains the informative warnings while fixing the parsing issue

**Files Modified:**
1. **k8r.py** - Lines 1050, 1052, 1232, 1234
   - Added `file=sys.stderr` parameter to all secret warning print statements
   - Preserved warning functionality while fixing YAML output contamination

**Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ YAML output is now clean and parseable by kubectl
- ‚úÖ Warning messages still appear on stderr for user awareness
- ‚úÖ Both Jobs and Deployments work correctly with secrets in YAML mode
- ‚úÖ `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` validates generated YAML successfully

### Critical Fix - Resource Quantity Format Error

- [2025-07-13 16:00:00] üêõ **Issue Discovered**: Kubernetes rejected deployments with invalid quantity format `memory: 12gb`
- [2025-07-13 16:10:00] ‚úÖ **Root Cause**: The `parse_resource_spec()` function was returning raw values like "12gb" instead of Kubernetes-compatible formats
- [2025-07-13 16:15:00] ‚úÖ **Kubernetes Requirements**: Memory quantities must use formats like "12Gi" (gibibytes) or "12G" (gigabytes), not "12gb"
- [2025-07-13 16:20:00] ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Enhanced `parse_resource_spec()` with `normalize_quantity()` function to convert formats automatically
- [2025-07-13 16:25:00] ‚úÖ **Tested**: Verified fix with kubectl dry-run validation

**The Problem:**
- Error: `quantities must match the regular expression '^([+-]?[0-9.]+)([eEinumkKMGTP]*[-+]?[0-9]*)$'`
- User-friendly formats like "12gb" were being passed directly to Kubernetes
- Kubernetes requires specific unit suffixes: Gi, Mi, G, M, etc.

**The Fix:**
- Added `normalize_quantity()` helper function inside `parse_resource_spec()`
- Converts "gb" ‚Üí "Gi" (gibibytes) for proper Kubernetes format
- Converts "mb" ‚Üí "Mi" (mebibytes) for proper Kubernetes format  
- Keeps other valid formats unchanged (m, G, M, etc.)
- Applied to both single values and range specifications

**Files Modified:**
1. **k8r.py:76-101** - Enhanced `parse_resource_spec()` method
   - Added nested `normalize_quantity()` function
   - Automatic format conversion for user-friendly input
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing formats

**Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ `--mem 12gb` now generates `memory: 12Gi` in YAML output
- ‚úÖ `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` validates successfully  
- ‚úÖ Both Jobs and Deployments work with normalized quantities
- ‚úÖ Range formats work: `--mem 2gb-8gb` ‚Üí requests: 2Gi, limits: 8Gi
- ‚úÖ Other formats preserved: `--cpu 1000m` unchanged
